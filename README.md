__Mechanical Designer__: Harrison Katz

## Project Components
_Part 1_

Create a simulation in MATLAB to get a better understanding of how to best develop a mapping 
algorithm that is able to allow the robot to map the entire maze, keep track of all relevant 
information, and do this with minimal memory and movements. 

_Part 2_

Translate the algorithm into C++ and perform relevant testing.

_Part 3_ - (Current state of project as of 1/8/2017)

Developing the mechanical and electrical design of the micromouse robot.

_Part 4_

Buying components, full/sub system integration, and full/sub system testing.
